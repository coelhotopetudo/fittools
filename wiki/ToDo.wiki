#Things that we need to do to get this to version 0.1

= Things To Do =

 * ~~Implement Fixture Parameters~~
 * ~~Implement selenium native browser control options from Selenium IDE~~
 * Implement specialized browser control options from Selenium IDE
   * I'm afraid I'll have to do a lot of replicating as some options from SeleniumIDE are not natively supported in Selenium.  For instance, waitForTextPresent is not natively supported, you must check isTextPresent() every second in a loop, and break when it's found.  I'll have a list of supported commands up once I figure out how I'm going to do this.
 * Implement assert commands from selenium IDE 
   * I'm not going to support Verify commands since asserts return a value that in FitNesse determines whether the test passes or fails.



= Notes To Visitors=
This is a checklist of things that need to happen before I can release a version suitable for use (0.1).  If you can think of other things that FitTools should be able to do, please email them to me and I'll see what I can do to get them implemented
