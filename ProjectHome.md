# FitTools: A Plugin for FitNesse #

## What Is FitTools? ##
FitTools is a two-part plugin for FitNesse consisting of:

  * A format for Selenium IDE that provides support for FitNesse AND
  * An accompanying JAR for FitNesse that Implements the Selenium IDE commands within the FitNesse Framework.

FitTools works with FitNesse to give you access to all Selenium IDE commands, Allowing even the smallest Quality Assurance and Development teams the ability to quickly build feature-rich Selenium based automated functional tests of their Web Sites and Web 2.0 Applications.  Since the Selenium IDE writes the test cases and FitNesse with FitTools can now execute those test cases with minimal user input, testing teams can now quickly build functional automated tests and suites even with limited technical knowledge.

FitTools also includes many custom fixtures which provide data manipulation and computation above and beyond what Selenium is capable of providing out of the box.  Using FitTools, you won't have to go through all the stress of building your own tool to test your web application, I've done that work for you.
